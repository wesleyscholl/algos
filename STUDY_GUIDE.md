## üß† Learning Techniques

### 1. **Active Recall**
After solving a problem:
- Close the code
- Explain approach out loud
- Rewrite from memory
- Compare with original

### 2. **Spaced Repetition**
Review schedule:
- Day 1: Solve problem
- Day 3: Resolve without hints
- Day 7: Solve similar variant
- Day 14: Explain to someone else

### 3. **Pattern Recognition Drill**
When seeing a new problem:
1. Identify pattern (30 seconds)
2. Sketch approach (2 minutes)
3. Write code (15 minutes)
4. Test & optimize (5 minutes)
